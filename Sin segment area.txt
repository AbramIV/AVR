S = (-311/2pi50) * (cos(2pi50*(0.01)) - 1) = 2.38; - area of half-wave of sinusoid

S = 1.1905*(cos(314.1593*(T))-1);

Example:
S = 1.19;
To find X in the equation:
1.19 = -1.1905*(cos(2π50*(X))-1)
We can start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side:
-1.1905*(cos(2π50*(X))-1) = -1.1905cos(2π50(X)) + 1.1905
Now we can isolate the cosine function on one side of the equation:
-1.1905cos(2π50(X)) = 1.19 - 1.1905
cos(2π50*(X)) = (1.19 - 1.1905) / (-1.1905)
Next, we can use the inverse cosine function to solve for X:
2π50*(X) = cos⁻¹((1.19 - 1.1905) / (-1.1905))
2π50*(X) ≈ 1.569 radians
X = (cos⁻¹((1.19 - 1.1905) / (-1.1905))) / (2π50)
X ≈ 0.005 seconds
Therefore, the solution for X in the given equation is approximately 0.005 seconds.
